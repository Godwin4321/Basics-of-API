This is a simple API you created using Flask in Python. It listens for requests at the /temperature endpoint and responds based on the query parameter city.

# weather_api.py (Flask - Python example)


from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/temperature')
def get_temperature():
    city = request.args.get('city')
    if city == "London":
        return jsonify({"city": city, "temperature": "18°C"})
    else:
        return jsonify({"error": "City not found"}), 404

app.run()

What happens in this API?

When someone sends a request like:
GET /temperature?city=London
It returns:
{ "city": "London", "temperature": "18°C" }
For any other city, it returns a 404 error with:
{ "error": "City not found" }
